## ASV setup

This package contains global configs and the main launchfiles. The reason for putting these in a separate package is to be able to reach the aforementioned files from anywhere in a simple manner.

### Config
The config folder contains physical parameters related to the AUV and the environment

There are currently no physical parameters

### Launch
This package contains a launchfile for each specific ASV. Additionally the shoreside.launch.py file is to
be used on the topside computer that the joystick is connected to, for ROV operations.
